## Welcome to CS 159!

The goal of the class is to bring students up to speed in two topics in modern machine learning research through a series of lectures. Students will then go on to conduct a mini research project at the end of the class. The two topics are:

1. [Predictive control & model-based reinforcement learning](/control);
2. [Neural network theory: learning & generalisation](/learning).

### Structure

- Weeks 1--3: lectures on reinforcement learning & control;
- Weeks 4--6: lectures on neural network theory;
- Weeks 7--10: research project and special guest lectures.

### Grading

The final grade will be based 20% on homeworks and 80% on the final project.

### Homeworks

Homeworks will be set on Thursday and due the Thursday after, as follows:

| #    | Date set        | Date due	  	  | Resources              |
| ----------- | --------------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| 1  | 4/01     | 4/08    |  |
| 2  | 4/08     | 4/15    |  |
| 3  | 4/22     | 4/29    |  |
| 4  | 4/29     | 5/06    |  |

### Final project

The final project will be conducted during the last four weeks of class. Students are encouraged to work in teams. Students may either pick one of the special topics to build their project on, or alternatively they may attempt to mix the two.

### Office hours

Office hours will be held on Wednesdays from 9--11am on [the class Discord server](https://discord.gg/vMn5fgjYkq). Students are encouraged to use the Discord freely at other times to discuss homeworks, projects and any other class-related matters.
