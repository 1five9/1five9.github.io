## Welcome to CS 159!

The goal of the course is to bring students up to speed in two topics in modern machine learning research through a series of lectures. Students will then go on to conduct a guided mini-project in each topic. The topics that will be covered are:

1. [Predictive control & model-based reinforcement learning](/control);
2. [Neural network theory: learning & generalisation](/learning).

### Structure

Each topic will last 5 weeks, and will be structured as:

- Weeks 1--3: lectures;
- Weeks 4--5: project.

### Grading

The final grade will be based 20% on homeworks and 80% on the two projects.
